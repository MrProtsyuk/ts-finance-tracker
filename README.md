# ts-finance-tracker

A finance tracker that was built during an online course which then I slightly altered to make my own.

This project was built using:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - TypeScript
    
I made it my own by adding
    - Different styles
    - CSS Transitions/animations

It is not much but it is one of my first few projects using TypeScript.
